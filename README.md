# Image Saving and Base64 Encoding Script
Based on the original SaveImage node from ComfyUI
This ComfyUI node provides functionality to save images in PNG format while simultaneously generating and returning their Base64 encoded strings. 
This is particularly useful for applications that require image data to be transmitted as strings, such as web applications.


## Features
- Saves images in PNG format.
- Returns Base64 encoded strings of the saved images.
- Supports metadata handling for saved images.
- Allows for different output types and file naming conventions.
